Hello! I'm Puming (Oscar) Jiang, an MRes student at Imperial College London, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning under the guidance of [Dr. Nicole Salomons](https://www.nicolesalomons.com/). My academic foundation was fortified at the esteemed University of Cambridge, where I achieved a MEng in Information and Computer Engineering, consistently earning First Class Honors and receiving significant accolades.

My research passion lies at the intersection of AI techonology and humans. Currently, I'm exploring the potential of multimodal inputs with the objective to elevate the capabilities of robotic tutoring. The primary goal is to incorporate diverse inputs to offer more nuanced and tailored feedback to learners, enhancing the overall learning experience.

In my previous experimence, I jointly develped of "ImageTalk," an innovative system designed to harness the rich information contained in images, significantly enhancing text generation efficiency for AAC users. This breakthrough not only showcases the potential of image-to-text conversion but also represents a significant stride in keystroke savings for users, making communication more seamless. The culmination of this effort is a paper currently under review for presentation at the IUI 2024 conference.
