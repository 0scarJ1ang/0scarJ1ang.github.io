Hello! I'm Puming (Oscar) Jiang, an MRes student at Imperial College London, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning under the guidance of [Dr. Nicole Salomons](https://www.nicolesalomons.com/). My academic foundation was fortified at the esteemed University of Cambridge, where I achieved a MEng in Information and Computer Engineering, consistently earning First Class Honors and receiving significant accolades.

My research passion lies at the intersection of technology and education. Currently, I'm exploring the potential of multimodal inputs to enhance robotic tutoring, aiming to provide more tailored feedback to learners. This is but a snippet of my comprehensive involvement in AI-driven projects. From innovating the "ImageTalk" text generation system to harnessing deep learning for rainforest regeneration and introducing early diagnosis systems in the medical field, I'm consistently motivated by the transformative potential of AI.
